 * itself, and Vite reports it as vite:preloadError (src/main.ts). Loading the
 * page again brings the new screens; the game keeps its board in storage.
 * vegtab hit this (its #86). The puzzle worker is not covered: when it fails
 * to load, the board is made on the page instead (puzzle-generation.ts).
 *
 * Returns whether to reload: online only (offline the reload would only lose
 * the screen), and not twice within a minute. `storage` is the tab's own
 * (sessionStorage), so one tab's reload does not hold another back.
